***A suite of tools for linguistic research. :mag_right: :scroll:***

## ABOUT :bboks:

Since I needed some tools for some linguistic research this semester, I thought I'd write the tools I need myself in Rust. This Cargo workspace contains these tools. For installation instructions for a certain tool, click on the link to the tool below.

- [XMLIFY](xmlify/README.markdown): Serialize speech transcripts as XML.
- [CRAWLY](crawly/README.markdown): Search for specific words and surrounding text in a dataset of text (files)
